Hey professor! üëã

This hackathon is an ideal experience for your students to improve their knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, particularly about language models in the real world: challenges, development, applications, risks, and much more ü§ì

## ‚ùì Frequently asked questions

- **Can I use the hackathon as an activity in the classroom?** Yes, as long as the dates and conditions set for the rest of the participants are respected.
- **Is there a maximum number of teams per university or teacher?** No, the more, the better! The maximum number of people per team is 5.
- **Can you give a presentation about the community and the event for my university or class?** Yes, of course, contact us as soon as possible to set the date.
- **As a teacher, can I give a lecture or mentorship during the hackathon?** Absolutely! It will be a pleasure to have your students AND teachers. Fill out the corresponding form to propose a [lecture](https://forms.gle/YpUvifDNLG6E56Cy9) or a [mentorship](https://forms.gle/7UmsVDnFmNo1pCrf9).
- **Some of my students do not speak Spanish, is that a problem?** No, everyone is welcome, in this edition all instructions are translated into English.
- *NEW!* **Can we hold the hackathon in person at the university?** Yes, universities that want can make a room available to their students (and participants from the same city) where they can gather and develop their projects in person. Let us know so we can help you.

‚û°Ô∏è Send us an email at info@somosnlp.org, we count on you and your students!

If you are a student and would like your university to participate in the hackathon, tell your teacher!

## ‚ú® Collaboration and benefits

What we ask from collaborating universities:
- Publish posts encouraging participation before March 8
- Publish news, blog, or similar on their website before March 8
- Publish posts / blog announcing the results of the hackathon, (clearly they can focus on their students' projects!)

By giving visibility to the hackathon and presenting at least 1 team of students to the hackathon, the university becomes a sponsor and will have the corresponding benefits:
- University logo on the hackathon website and the registration page (*)
- University logo on the "Community" page (*)
- Thanks on social networks
- Tags in social network posts (x5)

(*) The logos of the collaborating universities will be ordered by the number of participating students.
