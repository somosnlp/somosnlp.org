Hello professor! üëã

This hackathon is an ideal experience for your students to improve their knowledge about Artificial Intelligence, particularly about language models in the real world: challenges, development, applications, risks, and much more ü§ì

By giving visibility to the hackathon and presenting at least 1 team of students to the hackathon, the university becomes a sponsor and will have the corresponding benefits:

- Tags in social media posts (x5)

(*) Collaborating universities' logos will be ordered by number of participating students.
