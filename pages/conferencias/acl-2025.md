In this session, we’ll introduce SomosNLP, the community dedicated to creating and sharing resources that enable and accelerate the development of NLP in Iberoamerican languages. In everyday language, Iberoamerica refers to the countries in the Americas where Spanish or Portuguese is spoken, and also includes Spain and Portugal. Our aim is to connect with individuals from the region, collaboratively exploring current challenges in the field. We’re creating a dynamic space for sharing knowledge, learning from diverse experiences, and devising innovative solutions together. We would like you to support us in our mission! Speakers of less represented languages are especially welcome to join and contribute to this vibrant, multilingual dialogue. We can’t wait to meet you!
