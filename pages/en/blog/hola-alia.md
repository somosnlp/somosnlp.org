ALIA, Europe's first public, open and multilingual AI infrastructure, was launched this week.

The project, coordinated by BSC, provides open and transparent language models to promote the use of Spanish and co-official languages in the development and deployment of AI.

This open-source 40B parameter model is available in Hugging Face, [give it a try!](https://huggingface.co/BSC-LT/ALIA-40b). Note that the training is still ongoing, so the available weights correspond to an intermediate checkpoint.
