**‘La Leaderboard’ is born, the first ranking table for language models in Spanish and the official languages**

*The ‘Leaderboard of Spanish Varieties and Official Languages’ is driven by the SomosNLP community in collaboration with language technology research groups*

Large Language Models (LLMs) have become a major player in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), facilitating the adoption of AI tools in many organizations. LLMs represent a major advancement in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and AI, and are designed to understand and generate text by mimicking the responses a human would give. The large amount of data used in training makes it possible to support other functionalities and content.

Given the rise of these large models, [SomosNLP](https://somosnlp.org/), an international community of Spanish-speaking NLP practitioners, detected the need to create a leaderboard to compare generative language models in their languages and quantitatively measure progress in this field. This is how the **‘Leaderboard of Spanish Varieties and Official Languages’** was born, the first leaderboard for generative models in Spanish and the official languages of Spain and LATAM.

The first version of generative language models’ leaderboard includes over 50 tasks in 4 languages (Spanish, Catalan, Basque and Galician) and assesses information extraction and summarisation skills, general culture, legal and clinical knowledge, logical reasoning and language proficiency.

It is worth noting that the creation of **‘La Leaderboard’** is the result of a collaboration between various research groups. Thus, the databases to evaluate each task have been donated by groups such as the [Language Technologies Unit from Barcelona Supercomputing Center](https://www.bsc.es/discover-bsc/organisation/research-departments/language-technologies-unit) (BSC), the [HiTZ](https://www.hitz.eus/) center of the University of the Basque Country, the University of Santiago de Compostela (USC) through the [CiTIUS](https://citius.gal/es/) (Centro Singular de investigación en Tecnologías Inteligentes) and [ILG](https://ilg.usc.gal/es) (Instituto da Lingua Galega), [LenguajeNatural.AI](https://lenguajenatural.ai/), the [Instituto de Ingeniería del Conocimiento (IIC)](https://www.iic.uam.es/), the [Grupo de Internet de Nueva Generación](https://www.upm.es/observatorio/vi/index.jsp?pageac=estructuras/grupo.jsp&idGrupo=261) (GING) of the Higher Technical School of Telecommunications Engineering of the Polytechnic University of Madrid (UPM), the [Grupo de Ingeniería Lingüística](http://grupos.iingen.unam.mx/iling/es-mx/Paginas/default.aspx) (GIL) of the National Autonomous University of México (UNAM), and the [Grupo de investigación en Sistemas Inteligentes de Acceso a la Información](https://sinai.ujaen.es/) (SINAI) of the University of Jaén.

All of this is led by SomosNLP through the [#Somos600M](https://somosnlp.org/somos600m) project, launched by this community with the aim of representing the diversity of the languages of Spain, LATAM and the Caribbean in the digital world. This objective is aligned with that of the [ILENIA](https://proyectoilenia.es/) project, promoted by the Ministry for Digital Transformation and the Civil Service and coordinated by the BSC, together with HiTZ, the USC and the CENID centre in Alicante. The UPM’s contributions to **‘La Leaderboard’** have been made possible thanks to the FUN4DATE and SMARTY projects funded by the State Research Agency. Likewise, thanks to the collaboration of LenguajeNatural.AI with professionals from the world of law and medicine, tasks originally developed in Spanish by experts in these fields have been included. To consider different Spanish varieties, collaborations with research groups from Spain, Mexico, Argentina and Chile have been established.

Among the key points of **‘La Leaderboard’**, we must mention that all the evaluation databases have been originally created or manually translated into the corresponding languages, an important point because the action of translating benchmarks includes errors and biases of the model, which makes it even more important to evaluate with “native” data.

To begin with, we have evaluated 4 multilingual models and all the pre-trained models in Spanish and official languages. We would like to thank [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co), the Barcelona Supercomputing Center and the Polytechnic University of Madrid for their support in providing GPUs for inference.

The evaluation data is open and the results reproducible, in order to ensure maximum transparency. In addition, anyone can request the evaluation of their models, which is carried out automatically. These last two characteristics, in addition to the diversity of tasks and languages, differentiate **‘La Leaderboard’** from the existing leaderboards for models in Spanish: [ODESIA](https://leaderboard.odesia.uned.es/), whose tasks are private to prioritize the legitimacy of the results, and [LMSYS Chatbot Arena](https://huggingface.co/spaces/lmsys/chatbot-arena-leaderboard), whose evaluations are manual.

Thus, questions such as ‘Which language model generates higher quality text in Spanish? And in Catalan?’ now have their answer, thanks to the [**‘Leaderboard of Spanish Varieties and Official Languages’**.](https://huggingface.co/spaces/la-leaderboard/la-leaderboard)
