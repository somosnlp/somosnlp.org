### üöÄ Objectives

This affinity workshop is aimed at LatinX individuals working on or interested in Computational Linguistics with a goal to increase the visibility of researchers of LatinX origin in the field. Participants will be able to engage in discussions about Computational Linguistics (formal and informal) and to share their thoughts on how to increase the presence of LatinX in Computational Linguistics.

### üìú Submission guidelines

We welcome extended abstracts that may introduce new theories, methodologies, or applications of NLP. Work may be previously published, completed, or ongoing. Submissions will be peer-reviewed by at least 2 reviewers in the area.

Specifically, we allow two types of submissions:
Archival: Must be blind for the double-blind review process. Accepted works will be published in the Journal of LatinX in AI Research as proceedings.
Non-archival: May be submitted to any venue in the future. Previously published work can also be submitted as non-archival, with the additional requirement to state in the first page the original publication source.
