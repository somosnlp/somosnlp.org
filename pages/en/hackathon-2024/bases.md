Each participating team will generate a corpus of instructions, train their LLM, and create a demo to share their great work with the community. This year the focus is on projects that represent the richness of Spanish and the diversity of Spanish-speaking people. As always, we encourage projects to have a social impact and be related to one of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals. Thank you for participating! ‚ú®

## ‚úÖ Steps to participate

Participating in our hackathon and applying your knowledge to democratize NLP in Spanish is very simple, go for it!

1. Join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/my8w7JUxZR) community (and introduce yourself in #intros!)

2. Create an account on [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/join) and join the [SomosNLP](https://huggingface.co/organizations/somosnlp/share/qgytUhPKvxVxsbZWTzVUAUSUnZmVXNPmjc) organization.

3. Register on [Eventbrite](https://hackathonsomosnlp2024.eventbrite.com/?aff=w), choose the "Hackathon (English)" ticket.

4. Create your team or join one (teams of 1 to 5 people). Teams must be registered in the #encuentra-equipo channel (more info in the channel's README).

5. Create your instruction corpus and push it to hf.co/somosnlp. We recommend using the `distilabel` library. Check the [example notebook](https://distilabel.argilla.io/latest/tutorials/pipeline-notus-instructions-preferences-legal/) provided by the Argilla team!

6. Write the [Dataset Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/dataset_card) for your dataset: inspect the dataset, evaluate, and mitigate biases.

7. Fine-tune an LLM (up to 7B) and push it to hf.co/somosnlp. You can train it directly from a Space in the HuggingFace hub using [autotrain (no-code)](https://huggingface.co/docs/autotrain/llm_finetuning) or [jupyterlab](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/spaces-sdks-docker-jupyter). You can use T4s sponsored by HuggingFace. Remember that it's very important to test on smaller machines to verify that the code is correct and not find errors after several hours of training.

8. Write the [Model Card](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards) for your model: evaluate its quality, biases, and carbon footprint. Important: link the dataset used for training.

9. Create a [demo Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces) to showcase your project to the community. You can use Nvidia T4 - small GPUs. Important: link the dataset(s) and model(s) used.

10. Submit your project by filling out the [submission form](https://forms.gle/zUhoHo45vRBoyMZD7). You can continue making modifications until 23h59 Anywhere on Earth on Sunday, April 10 (we will check the commit times üëÄ).

- Extra. You can present your project to the [Workshop LatinX in NLP @NAACL](https://somosnlp.org/blog/latinx-in-ai-at-naacl-2024).

11. Optionally, do a 5 min presentation of your project in front of the jury and the community.

Help us improve for the next edition by rating with stars different aspects of the hackathon in this [mini feedback form](https://forms.gle/jy6jNxxPYcUYmEkZ8). Thanks!

If you have any questions, we are at your disposal in the #pide-ayuda channel, write a descriptive title and select the "hackathon" tag.

We wish you much success! üöÄ

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

<details>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why should I participate?</summary>

</details>

<details>
<summary>What is the required level?</summary>

From the SomosNLP team, we want to encourage you to participate regardless of your current knowledge. In previous editions, we have had groups from research institutes and groups of undergraduate students, all projects add up!

We are at your disposal to help you in every step of the development of your project! Just post your question in the #pide-ayuda channel or ping us in your project's thread.

</details>

<details>
<summary>What does the complexity of the projects depend on?</summary>

We will provide an example of how to create a dataset, train a model, and create a demo. It's up to you and your team to choose how much to research and work to improve the base version. The difficulty also depends on the use case, the origin of the data, the time you dedicate to its curation, the training technique, the iterations you make, and how elaborate you want your demo to be. You are free to choose everything!

</details>

<details>
<summary>How long do I have to form a team?</summary>

Ideally all teams will be registered during the first week of the hackathon, until March 8th.

EDIT: We accept new teams until April 7th.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can I find a team?</summary>

Finding a team is easy! Check the README of the #encuentra-equipo channel on our Discord server!

You have two options:
- üëÄ Filter for posts from other participants who are "looking for people" and respond to them, OR
- üì¢ Create a new thread specifying the topic you would like to work on

We encourage diversity in teams, including a mix of skills, experiences, and backgrounds. This diversity often leads to more innovative and comprehensive projects.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Can there be teams of 1 person?</summary>

Yes, we accept teams between 1 and 5 people.

</details>

<details>
<summary>How do you recommend organizing the work?</summary>

- Use your project channel on Discord to communicate and organize
- Since it's an international hackathon, we recommend asynchronous communication or dividing the work and holding meetings with fewer people
- Schedule meetings or talk spontaneously using the new voice channels in the "SALAS DE REUNI√ìN" (meeting rooms) category on Discord
- Pin important messages in the project channel, e.g., task allocation, day of the next meeting, ... To pin a message, click on the three dots and select "Pin message"
- For better clarity, you can also create a shared document with team members to write down the project's objective, allocate tasks, and more (and pin the link in the chat)

</details>
