Thank you very much for your interest in supporting us to organize and give visibility to this wonderful event! In each of the three previous editions, **we had more than 500 registrations from 30 different countries each time and surpassed 5,000 views of our events**. This year our objective is to generate data that will allow us to develop inclusive language models, adapted to the diverse cultures of LATAM and the Iberian Peninsula.
