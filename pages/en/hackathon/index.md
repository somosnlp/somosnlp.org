There are 600M Spanish-speaking people, let's give this widely spoken and rich language a fair representation in the field of NLP. Participate in the SomosNLP Hackathon, an international online competition whose main objective is **to create open NLP resources in Spanish and co-official languages**.

The best part? EVERYONE can collaborate! 🎉

## 🚀 Our goals

The democratization of NLP in Spanish is our main goal at SomosNLP, and we believe that one of the best ways to move towards this goal is by promoting the creation of open NLP resources in our language.

In past editions, we had a total of more than 1000 participants from 30 different countries, we surpassed 20,000 views of our events, learned from 20 speakers, and developed 50 projects related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, demonstrating the potential of NLP to address social challenges. We're back for that and much more! 💪

In this third edition, we join the revolution of LLMs and continue setting high-impact goals:
1. 🌎 Create the largest **quality instruction corpus that represents the different varieties of Spanish** that allows us to train inclusive models.
2. ✅ Create the first **public leaderboard of LLMs in Spanish** that allows us to standardize how to evaluate and compare the different models in Spanish and co-official languages.

Join now the largest open-source Natural Language Processing hackathon in Spanish! 🚀
