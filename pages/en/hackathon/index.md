There are 600M Spanish-speaking people in the world. Spanish is the main language in 21 countries, each with a rich culture. Although LLMs present increasingly better multilingual capabilities, are they really multicultural? Join now the #HackathonSomosNLP, the largest open-source NLP hackathon in Spanish! 🚀

In past editions, we had in total more than 1500 participants from 30 different countries, we surpassed 20,000 views of our events, learned from 20 speakers, and developed 50 projects related to the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, demonstrating the potential of NLP to address social challenges. We're back for that and much more! 💪

In this fourth edition, we are going to create open-source resources to **evaluate and improve the cultural adequacy of LLMs with respect to each of the countries of LATAM and the Iberian Peninsula**.

The best part? EVERYONE can collaborate! 🎉

Here are all the links, keep reading for more information.
